- Misc. bug fixes.

rgain 1.3.1 (2013-11-29)
------------------------

rgain 1.3 (2013-10-28)
----------------------

- Work around a bug in some pygobject 3.10 releases
  (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=710447)
- Properly recognise file extensions even with different capitalisation.
- Overhaul album ID algorithm to be hopefully better at grouping files that
  belong to an album and, conversely, not mis-grouping files. Note that this
  change will invalidate any cache files you might still have so your entire
  collection will be re-scanned next time you run **collectiongain**.
- Assorted bug fixes.

------------------------

- Fix issue with reading MP3 reference loudness tags.

rgain 1.2 (2013-05-04)

- Support default GStreamer command-line options for **replaygain** and
  **collectiongain**. All known GStreamer options can be listed by using the
  **--help-gst** flag.
